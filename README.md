## Introduction

The **_Basic Detector_** is a project that aims to detect objects in images, videos, or through a webcam using the **_YOLOv8_** model. It is a fast and efficient way to detect objects in real-time or from a file based on a pre-trained model that can detect 80 different classes based on the **_COCO dataset_**.

The project is divided into two main parts: the **_Script_** and the **_Interface_** that allows the users to perform detections through is preferred method.


<!-- Mode: Script -->
## Mode #1: Script

The **_Script_** mode is a simple way to perform object detection using the **_YOLOv8_** model. It allows the users to perform detections on images, videos, or through a webcam using the terminal. More information about the script can be found in the [scripts folder](https://github.com/dorian-roux/Basic-Detector/tree/master/scripts).

## Mode #2: Interface

The **_Interface_** mode is a more user-friendly way to perform object detection using the **_YOLOv8_** model. It allows the users to perform detections on images, videos, or through a webcam using a graphical user interface. More information about the interface can be found in the [interface folder](https://github.com/dorian-roux/Basic-Detector/tree/master/interface)
